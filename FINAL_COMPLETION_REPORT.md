**The most challenging issue has been completely resolved:**

**Problem**: Gemini API returned format like `* **Morning (2h, $0):** Activity description` but parser couldn't extract activities.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed regex pattern: `/^\*\s*\*?\*?(Morning|Afternoon|Evening)[^:]*:\s*(.+)/i`
- Enhanced text cleaning and cost extraction
- Proper activity type detection and location parsing
- Comprehensive error handling

**Result**: AI itinerary generation now works end-to-end! ✅

### Enhanced User Experience
